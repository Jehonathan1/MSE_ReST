## Lessons

- **The local Media Sequencer is a bare rehearsal rig.** Ports up (REST 8580,
  actor 8595, STOMP 8582) but `/config/profiles` is empty, `/state/last_taken_element`,
  `/storage`, `/external` are `inexistent`, `/feeds/channelstate` emits nothing,
  and Pilot 8177 is down. So the `Yonathan` / `Awesome localhost` / template
  `16082` names in the old code are stale — they 404 / are absent. All three
  transport legs *handshake* locally (that's what the rig proves); a live take
  and the Line_1/Line_2 content are work-only. Full map in `LOCAL-MSE-SURVEY.md`.
- **On-air detection (proven shape):** STOMP channel-state →
  `state:channel` → `state:layer name="middle" type="transition_logic"` →
  `state:transition_logic_layer/@based_on` → `/pilotdb/elements/<id>` (element)
  or `/<id>/dataitems/last_open_template` (template). Off-air = element drops
  from the active set between frames.
- **Stage 1 recorder is read-only and decoupled from the legacy server.** It does
  not import `src/server/config/config.js` (which now pulls in `dotenv`); it keeps
  its own config resolver. The repo `.env` `MSE_HOST` is a full work URL the
  legacy server ignores — pass `--mse-host 127.0.0.1` for local runs (the recorder
  also strips scheme/port from a host value defensively).
- **1-line vs 2-line is `is Line_2 empty?`** — a single derivation
  (`deriveVariant`) shared by recorder and replay, matching the real `line2Change`
  script. Exclusive ("בלעדי") is a separate configurable field.
- **Detection is normalized behind adapters: Director = actor, Trio = STOMP.**
  (`src/recorder/adapters/`.) Each adapter only DETECTS and emits the core's
  normalized `take`/`off-air` events tagged with its `source`; the core keeps the
  Pilot join, on-air map and JSONL writer. `--source director|trio|auto` picks
  which run (`auto` = both; the on-air-map `if (onAir.has(id)) return` de-dupes
  overlapping take **and** off-air across them). Stage 2c's Trio work slots in
  with zero core changes.
- **Take-out / off-air comes from the actor DIRECTOR stream, not STOMP.** The
  element's on-air state rides its scheduler **line** path as a letter —
  `state/current A` ⇒ take, else (`O`/`current out`) ⇒ out (`offair.js`, ported
  from `director-with-out`'s `checkForOffAirActions`). It's keyed on the element
  **path**, not the channel **name**, so a wrong `--channel` can't disable it.
  Requires `protocol peptalk events uri` (Stage 1 used `noevents`, so it never
  saw an `out`).
- **STOMP was silent under the Director path at work — expected, not a bug.** The
  Stage-1 work capture (`recordings/2026-06-16T14-29-22.775Z.jsonl`) recorded 3
  takes (template **16097**) + 1 change but **zero off-airs**: every take came
  from the actor `last_taken_element` while the STOMP channel-state feed emitted
  nothing (per-channel subscription used a wrong channel name). That capture was
  hard-killed, so its `replay` truncation warning (dangling on-air element, no
  session stop) is **expected** — the takes/changes still reconstruct. STOMP is
  now a best-effort supplement; the Director adapter is the reliable signal.
- **(Stage 2c) KB cross-validation of the two programs' OUT signals.** Two
  programs drive on-air at i24, and the split is now confirmed against both the
  official MSE docs and the proven branches: **Viz Director → PepTalk
  `/scheduler` + `/state/system/log`** (OUT detection); **Viz Trio → STOMP
  `/feeds/channelstate`** (off-air by absence from the `transition_logic` layer).
  `--source auto` runs both; the on-air map records a both-legs take/out once.
- **(Stage 2c) The official PepTalk event model is the authority — it generalizes
  the branch heuristic.** The Vizrt *"Media Sequencer document and API"* (§*The
  PepTalk Protocol*) defines exactly **five event verbs — delete/insert/move/
  replace/set** — serialized in uri form. An OUT is a `set`/`replace` on the
  element's transition-logic state node (`A`→`O`) **or** a `delete` removing it
  from the active state path. The `director-with-out` regex (`set text
  …/state/current O`) *is* the `set` verb — the official model just adds the
  `delete`/`replace` forms (now handled in `offair.js`) and the **`<id> begin`
  framing** that marks events caused by *our own* command (so a `subscribe`'s
  initial-state snapshot can't masquerade as a live take; external events have no
  preceding own-`begin`). Events must be enabled (`events`, not `noevents`).
  Where the doc and a branch heuristic differ, the doc wins.
- **(Stage 2c) The green `/scheduler`-only fixture had masked the missing
  `/state/system/log` signal.** Stage 2b's lone A→O actor fixture passed, which
  hid that the KB's three-signal OUT (`/scheduler` + system-log cleanup +
  line-name cross-reference) was incomplete — `director-with-out` *subscribed*
  `/state/system/log` but never parsed the `Cleaning up viz-handlers…` cleanup
  line, and there was no line-name fallback for an **ID-less** OUT. Both are now
  implemented and each has its own fixture (`stripe-cleanup`, `stripe-byline`),
  alongside an official-`delete`-verb fixture (`stripe-delete`). Lesson: a single
  happy-path fixture is not coverage — fixture **per signal**.
- **(Stage 3) The Stage-2d captures are SUFFICIENT for the Stage-4 bridge —
  replay is now the formal sufficiency check + a stable timeline contract.**
  `timeline.js` (`buildTimeline` / `node timeline.js <file> --emit|--report`, also
  `replay.js --emit|--report`) emits the normalized bridge contract per Stripe
  instance — `{elementId, templateId, tookAt, leftAt|stillOnAir, variant,
  states:[{at,variant,texts,fields}], exclusiveGate:[{at,on}]}` — documented in
  `TIMELINE-SCHEMA.md`. The 16-event end-to-end capture reconstructs to **5
  TWO_LINE Stripe instances + one exclusive-gate window + clean close**, committed
  as `test/fixtures/live/2026-06-17T09-15-40.203Z.timeline.json` (the gitignored
  `recordings/` captures are mirrored byte-for-byte under `test/fixtures/live/` so
  the artifact + its tests survive a fresh clone). The exclusive Gate is
  derived from the **co-airing template-16092 element** (take ⇒ gate ON on the
  concurrent stripe, off-air ⇒ gate OFF), kept OUT of the stripe list and folded
  into the concurrent stripe — NOT from a 16097 field. The Trio-only 4-event
  capture correctly reconstructs to **zero instances + clean close** (a PASS, not a
  failure). **Known non-blocking gaps** (surfaced by `--report`, not papered over):
  (1) the exclusive-badge Pilot field number is still unidentified, so per-stripe
  `exclusive` stays `null` — the bridge uses the 16092 gate instead; (2) no live
  ONE_LINE stripe was captured — variant is derived ("is Line_2 empty?") and
  unit-proven, not faked; (3) a template-only take would carry `elementId:null` —
  not a Stripe data element, none in these captures. **Stage-3 issue: CLOSED — the
  capture is sufficient; the bridge can be built against the committed contract.**
- **(Stage 6b wire fixes) The two live-shoot wire gaps are TWO SEPARATE SIGNALS,
  fixed independently off-network (branch `wire-fixes-2026-06-23`).** The shoot
  (§8.5) proved a same-stripe out/in and an on-air edit touch the live MSE/engine
  through *different* channels, so they need different fixes — neither is the other.
  - **§4.1 same-stripe out/in — take detection keyed only off `last_taken_element`
    path changes** (`directorAdapter._handleLastTaken`), which **freeze** on a
    re-take to the same line, so the re-in emitted no take. The line **A/O** event
    stream (`/scheduler/*/element/*/lines/LM-Line_*/state/current`, A=on-air/O=off)
    *was* received and correctly classified as take/out by `offair.parseDirectorEvent`
    — `_handleDirectorEvent` just never **emitted** a take from an 'A'. **Fix:** emit
    a take on line state→A, attributed via `lineToElement[lineName]` (populated by the
    first take; live line frames carry `element=?`) → fallback current active element.
    The core's on-air map de-dupes the overlap with `last_taken`, so a distinct take
    is still recorded once; the OUT no longer forgets its line→element map, so the same
    line returning 'A' resolves back to the same element.
  - **§8.3 on-air edit — the content-poll re-read only the saved Pilot DB element**
    (`recorder._refreshOnAirContent → GET /dataelements/<id>`), which an on-air edit
    never writes back to (caching ruled out: byte-identical body + same etag). The
    edited text lives in the **MSE document** on the element node's `<entry
    name="data">` subnodes (API §"Live Update Support"). **Fix:** also source on-air
    content from there via **PepTalk** on the actor socket already held (`:8595`) —
    `parseMseElementData` + `directorAdapter.getNode` (read-only `get`) + a **separate
    `mseSig` baseline** that emits a `change` (`source:'mse'`) when the live signature
    moves; absent/transient live node tolerated. New content-source: **MSE element data
    subnodes**, in addition to Pilot REST.
  - **Both proven reproduce-first** (fixtures + `node --test`, classified through the
    recorder's own `offair.parseDirectorEvent` — no hand-rolled parser): each new case
    FAILS on HEAD, PASSES after. **Both still need LIVE CONFIRMATION on the next on-site
    trip** — the local rig has no live takes/content, so the wire behavior (frozen
    `last_taken`, the `<entry name="data">` shape/index base, the live `get` path) can't
    be driven here. Out of scope and untouched: the renderer/viz-to-gsap, off-air
    detection, the live-server bridge/mapping contract (keys on `type`, not `source`),
    §4.2 empty-L2 TWO_LINE labeling, §4.3 exclusive field.

- **(Issue 1 / night-59 — profile CLEANUP doesn't clear the mirrors) A profile
  cleanup is INVISIBLE on the MSE actor stream; the only read-only signal is the
  Viz Engine command console (6100).** On-site 2026-06-25 (viz-to-gsap session
  "Open Issue 4"): an operator profile/engine **cleanup** left the HE/EN/FR mirrors
  STUCK on the last on-air stripe — the recorder logged **0 lines** for it, while a
  normal take-OUT cleared all three (so the mapper→conductor path is fine; the gap
  was **detection at the recorder**).
  - **Step-0 docs (official MSE doc / KB; WebSearch was unavailable, KB-only).**
    `cleanup` is a documented **Profile Command** (`POST /profiles/<p>/cleanup`,
    rel="cleanup"; siblings: initialize/take/continue/out) — **profile-scoped, not
    element-scoped**. `/state/last_taken_element` is the *take cursor* ("the element
    handler … records the last taken element"); **nothing documents a cleanup
    clearing it** — it stays FROZEN, which is exactly why the mirrors stick.
    `playout_slots` has `clear_all(profile)` (notifications under
    `/state/playout_slots_notifications`) and the STOMP **channel state** can clear,
    but at this Director-driven site neither is populated (channelstate carries no
    `based_on`; last_taken drives takes). Engine ref confirms `RENDERER SET_OBJECT
    SCENE*x` = load, **empty `SET_OBJECT` = unload**. **Dev MSE 5.3.5 probe** (live,
    read-only): `/state/last_taken_element` is `inexistent` when nothing is taken,
    `/state/playout_slots_notifications` exists-but-empty, and an implicit
    `on_cleanup` handler + a `viz_cleanup` logic path exist but write **no
    observable `/state`** — corroborating that a cleanup leaves the MSE side silent.
  - **Root cause + detector.** The cleanup is executed MSE→engine on **6100** as
    three empty `RENDERER*<LAYER> SET_OBJECT` (unload FRONT/MAIN/BACK) + a `SCENE/
    GEOM/IMAGE/FONT/MATERIAL/MAPS CACHE CLEANUP` block — none of which touches the
    VDOM / `last_taken` / per-line A/O the recorder subscribes to, and the
    `/Cleaning up viz-handlers/` system-log line is NOT emitted at this site. So
    detection MUST read the engine console. New **opt-in** `--engine-console`
    detector: `src/recorder/engineConsole.js` (pure per-line classifier) +
    `adapters/engineConsoleAdapter.js` (CONSOLE REDIRECT + FLUSH poll + tail, read-
    only, self-owned 6100 socket) emits a `clear`; the core fans it out to off-air
    **every** on-air element (`recorder._onClearSignal`), so a tailing mirror goes
    `op=hold → op=clear` with **no mapper/live-server change**.
  - **False-positive guard.** Fires only on the cleanup-specific signal — a `…
    CLEANUP` verb OR an all-layer unload (≥2 empty `SET_OBJECT`). A normal take-out
    (one-layer clear, no CLEANUP block), a `SET_OBJECT SCENE*x` load, and the idle-
    console `failed to process command …GEOM*TYPE` flood all classify as non-clear.
  - **Reproduce-first + DEFERRED live confirmation.** Fixture
    `test/fixtures/engine-cleanup.console.txt` (the on-site block + real dev-console
    noise) drives the recorder's own classifier; `node --test` green. The pure
    classifier, the one-clear-per-block latch, and the core fan-out are offline-
    proven; the live socket/file glue was **smoke-tested read-only against the live
    engine** (connect + redirect + poll + self-correcting tail, no throw) but the
    end-to-end *take→cleanup→clear* still needs an operator-triggered cleanup. Out
    of scope & untouched: mapper/live-server/conductor (`op==='takeout'` already
    clears), translation (night 57), the red-line bug (night 58). Read-only
    throughout. **Open question for next on-site:** the raw events-mode tap
    `_cleanup-probe.js` (EVENTS, subscribes `/scheduler/*`, `/state/system/log`,
    `/state/playout`, `/state/playout_slots_notifications`) confirms whether the MSE
    emits ANY raw-but-unparsed frame on a cleanup, or truly nothing — re-confirm with
    the exact 2384347-style repro.

- **(Issue 1 / night-60 — engine-console cleanup DETECTION confirmed LIVE at home;
  self-driven, no other app, no button.)** night-59 built + offline-proved the
  detector but deferred the live end-to-end because firing a cleanup was a GUI action.
  night-60 removed that dependency with a **test-only TCP driver** (`scripts/engine-
  trigger.js`) that replicates — engine-direct over 6100 — the exact commands the MSE
  fires at the engine during a profile cleanup, run against the **live local engine
  (Viz 3.14.5.102205)**. The self-run (`scripts/night60-pipeline.js`, 13/13 PASS) drives
  the REAL `Recorder` + REAL `EngineConsoleAdapter` (real socket, real `CONSOLE
  REDIRECT` + file tail) and asserts: load → **no** false clear; a faithful cleanup →
  **exactly one** engine-sourced clear that off-airs the on-air stripe; a single-layer
  take-out → **no** over-fire; the per-element director off-air still clears. A
  viz-to-gsap **live-server** mirror over the JSONL (decoupled — JSONL + HTTP only)
  goes **op=hold → op=clear** (`scripts/night60-mirror-capture.js`, 4/4 PASS). Evidence
  archived under `test/fixtures/live/night60/` (`RUN.md` + console excerpt + driver
  command logs + JSONL + mirror state).
  - **REAL vs SEEDED (honest).** REAL: the engine-console cleanup **detection** leg —
    the night-59 deferred thing, now live. SEEDED: the MSE **take** (a live MSE take +
    Pilot content are work-only on the bare rig, so the actor/STOMP legs are stubbed and
    the on-air element is injected via the recorder's own `_onTakeSignal`). **Still
    on-site only:** an MSE-driven take + an MSE-driven (`rel="cleanup"`) profile cleanup
    against a populated profile.
  - **The home rig needs two engine settings the on-site broadcast engine has standing
    (Viz External Commands Manual).** `MAIN SHOW_COMMANDS ON` makes the engine echo
    received commands to the console (without it, `CONSOLE REDIRECT` captures only
    `JOINING/LEAVING SESSION` — the cleanup is invisible); `MAIN SWITCH_EXTERNAL ON`
    puts it in on-air/control mode so `SET_OBJECT`/CLEANUP **execute** (else
    `ERROR … the command is not allowed in this mode`). The **driver** sets these (and
    restores OFF after); the recorder never does — it stays read-only.
  - **Live console format ≠ the on-site fixture (locked in).** The live engine echoes
    commands **wrapped**: `…(TCP): receive <0 SCENE CLEANUP>`, not the bare `SCENE
    CLEANUP` of `engine-cleanup.console.txt`. The classifier still latches one clear
    through the wrapper (the CLEANUP verb is a substring match); the bare-only all-layer-
    unload heuristic is not needed (every real cleanup carries the CACHE CLEANUP block).
    Deliberately **not** hardened to strip the wrapper — the engine's own `GUI: receive
    <… SET_OBJECT >` layer clears during the on-air switch would then risk a false
    all-layer-unload. New fixture `test/fixtures/engine-cleanup.wrapped.console.txt` +
    `test/engine-trigger.test.js` guard both the driver command shapes and the wrapped
    format. Read-only throughout; no recorder write path, no MSE POST, no mapper/live-
    server/conductor change.

## Stage-1 deliverable: recorder → JSONL → replay (for viz-to-gsap Stage 3/4)

`record.js` writes one JSON object per line (see `RECORDER.md` for the full
schema). The line types Stage 3/4 consume: a `session` header (carries config:
`stripeTemplateId`, `line1Field`, `line2Field`, `exclusiveField`), `take` /
`change` events with joined Pilot `content { fields{}, texts[] }` + `variant`
(`ONE_LINE`/`TWO_LINE`) + `exclusive`, and `off-air`. `take`/`change` also embed
`pilotXml` (raw) for provenance. `replay.js` reconstructs the per-instance Stripe
timeline (take → content/variant transitions → off-air) and is the offline
verifier. The bridge maps: take→In, change→Change, off-air→Out, exclusive→Gate.
